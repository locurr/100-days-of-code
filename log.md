# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 11: Aug 1, 2017

Today, I began the [NodeSchool](https://github.com/workshopper/javascripting) JavaScripting workshop on [c9](https://c9.io/?redirect=0), and will be completing it alongside freeCodeCamp JavaScript challenges to reinforce concepts.

### Day 10: July 23, 2017

**Today's progress**: Unfofunately, I had a hectic week and was unable to budget time to code and really allow myself to think about what I was doing. Today, I began the "Basic JavaScript" section on freeCodeCamp, completing 20 excercises or so.

**Thoughts/Notes**: Once my school course is over in a week, I will have far more time to work on and complete projects.

### Days 8 + 9: July 15 + 16, 2017

**Two day's progress**: I wasn't able to take time to log my work saturday, but I worked on and published my webpage for my DJ brand, [Hoologan](http://djhoologan.com). Today, I completed the first section of the git course on [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/currlo). I will continue and hopefully finish the course tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: Following the git course, I might continue to break up the HTML work with learning swift and tinkering with xcode.

### Day 7: Friday July 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed the tribute project for freeCodeCamp. Before I begin the Personal Portfolio FCC project, I am switching over to codecademy to brush up on HTML and CSS.

**Notes/Thoughts**: In the coming days, I am going to delve into a mobile programming language (most likely Swift) either fully or as something to just break up the HTML coding. >>[Inspiration](http://samvlu.com/).

### Day 6: Thursday July 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the tribute page project; added timeline events, tried jQuery fadeIn but did not work. 

**Notes/Thoughts**: Will finish content tomorrow, time was cut short today.

### Day 5: Wednesday July 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Began the [freeCodeCamp tribute page project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-tribute-page). Completed the header and added a couple of images. 

**Notes/Thoughts**: Trying to only *reference* the example project, while keeping similar design and functionality. I plan to add some animations with the jQuery skills I learned [earlier](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/target-elements-by-id-using-jquery).

### Day 4: Tuesday July 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed HTML, Bootstrap basics, and jQuery. Current [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/currlo) score [112].

**Notes/Thoughts**: Excited to begin the first big project, the tribute page, tomorrow.

### Day 3: Monday July 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked for 1:15 tonight. Hit CSS and styling hard. Reached [70] on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/currlo).

**Notes/Thoughts**:

### Day 2: Sunday July 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Jumped into HTML refreshing. Worked for an hour on completing the front end challenges. Up to [ 32 ] on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: In coming days, I plan on at least doubling my coding time, when possible.

### Day 1: Saturday July 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.
