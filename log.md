# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 7: Friday July 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed the tribute project for freeCodeCamp. Before I begin the Personal Portfolio FCC project, I am switching over to codecademy to brush up on HTML and CSS.

**Notes/Thoughts**: In the coming days, I am going to delve into a mobile programming language (most likely Swift) either fully or as something to just break up the HTML coding. >>[Inspiration](http://samvlu.com/).

### Day 6: Thursday July 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the tribute page project; added timeline events, tried jQuery fadeIn but did not work. 

**Notes/Thoughts**: Will finish content tomorrow, time was cut short today.

### Day 5: Wednesday July 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Began the [freeCodeCamp tribute page project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-tribute-page). Completed the header and added a couple of images. 

**Notes/Thoughts**: Trying to only *reference* the example project, while keeping similar design and functionality. I plan to add some animations with the jQuery skills I learned [earlier](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/target-elements-by-id-using-jquery).
